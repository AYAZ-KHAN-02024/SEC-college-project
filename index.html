        <h3>Definition:</h3>
        <p class="list1">
            A computer is an electronic machine that receives input, processes data according to given instructions,
            stores information, and produces meaningful output. It works with the help of hardware (physical parts) and
            software (programs). When you give a command—like typing on a keyboard, clicking a mouse, or tapping on a
            screen—the computer understands it as input.

            Inside the computer, a powerful part called the CPU (Central Processing Unit) processes the data at
            extremely high speed. The computer also has memory and storage systems that help it temporarily hold
            information (RAM) or save it permanently (hard drive or SSD). After processing the input, the computer shows
            the result on the screen, prints it, or performs another action that you can understand.

            Computers can perform millions of operations in just one second. They do not make mistakes unless the
            instructions are wrong, and they never get tired or bored. These qualities—speed, accuracy, reliability, and
            ability to store large amounts of data—make computers far more efficient than humans when it comes to
            calculations, repetitive work, and data processing.

            Because of these features, computers are used everywhere today—education, business, hospitals, banking,
            science, entertainment, communication, and almost every field that needs fast and accurate work.</p> <br>

        <h1> ## Hardware vs Software</h1>
        <h2>Explanation:</h2>
        <p class="list1">
            A computer system is built from two essential components: hardware and software. Both are
            equally important, and one cannot function without the other.
        </p> <br>
        <ul class="list1">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bolder; color: aqua;">Hardware</span> Hardware refers to all the physical
                parts of a computer system. These are the components you can see and touch. Hardware includes devices
                that help you give input to the computer, display output, store information, and process data. Examples
                of hardware include the monitor, keyboard, mouse, CPU cabinet, hard disk, printer, speakers, and even
                internal parts like RAM, motherboard, and power supply. Without hardware, a computer would have no
                physical structure to work on.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bolder; color: aqua;">Software</span> refers to the programs, applications,
                and instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software cannot be touched or physically seen,
                because it is not a physical object—it exists as code written by programmers. However, you can see its
                output on the screen when you use apps like a web browser, games, calculator, or music player. Software
                controls how hardware works and guides the computer to perform specific tasks such as browsing the
                internet, playing videos, typing documents, or running a program.</li>

        <h1> ## Types of Storage</h1>
        <h2>Explanation:</h2>
        <p class="list1">
            Storage devices are essential parts of a computer that help in saving data, files, programs, and even the
            operating system so the computer can function properly. These devices hold information either temporarily or
            permanently. Temporary storage, such as RAM, is used while the computer is working; it stores data only for
            the time the computer is on and is cleared when it is turned off. Permanent storage, such as hard drives and
            SSDs, keeps data safe even when the computer is shut down, allowing you to save documents, photos, videos,
            software, and system files for future use. Together, temporary and permanent storage ensure that a computer
            can process information quickly and also preserve important data for long-term access.
        </p> <br>
        <h2>Two Major Types of Storage: </h2>
        <h3>1. Primary Storage (Main/Immediate Memory) </h3>
        <ul class="list1">
            <li>Directly connected to the CPU</li>
            <li>Very fast in use.</li>
            <li>Holds temporary data while processes are running</li>
            <li>Data is lost when power is turned off </li>
            <li>Examples: RAM (Random Access Memory), Cache Memory</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>2. Secondary Storage (Permanent Storage) </h3>
        <ul class="list1">
            <li>Stores data permanently</li>
            <li>Used to save files, software, and operating systems</li>
            <li>Holds temporary data while processes are running</li>
            <li>Slower than primary memory but has a larger capacity </li>
            <li>Examples: Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Solid State Drive (SSD), USB Flash Drive, Memory Card</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h1> ## Operating System</h1>
        <h2>Explanation:</h2>
        <p class="list1">
            An Operating System (OS) is a special type of system software that controls and manages all the hardware and
            software resources of a computer. It acts as a link between the user and the machine, making it possible for
            you to give commands and for the computer to understand and execute them. The OS handles tasks such as
            running applications, managing memory, organizing files, controlling input–output devices, and ensuring all
            hardware parts like the keyboard, mouse, CPU, and storage work together smoothly. Without an operating
            system, a computer would be unable to start, load programs, or perform even basic functions, because it
            would have no instructions on how to communicate with hardware or respond to user actions. In simple words,
            the OS is the “brain” that makes the computer usable, efficient, and capable of performing multiple tasks at
            the same time.
        </p> <br>
        <h2>Functions of an Operating System:</h2>
        <ul class="list1">

        <h1> ## Internet & Safety</h1>
        <h2>Internet Basics and Cyber Safety :</h2>
        <p class="list1">
            The Internet is a worldwide network of millions of computers and devices connected together to share
            information and communicate with each other. It allows people to send messages, browse websites, watch
            videos, study online, shop from anywhere, use social media, and perform countless everyday activities with
            just a few clicks. The internet works by transferring data across connected networks, making information
            accessible instantly from any part of the world. However, while the internet offers great convenience and
            opportunities, it also carries risks if not used carefully. Without proper safety practices—such as using
            strong passwords, avoiding suspicious links, and protecting personal information—users can face dangers like
            online scams, hacking, viruses, and data theft. Therefore, understanding how to use the internet safely is
            just as important as knowing how to use it effectively.
